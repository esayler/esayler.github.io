Finally, I've got around to setting up my personal blog!

I've settled on the popular combination of [Github Pages][github-pages] for free hosting and the ruby gem [Jekyll][jekyll-site] as my "CRM" to maintain and build this site.
[Jekyll][jekyll-site] greatly simplifies the site building process and allows
me to avoid writing raw HTML by writing posts in [Markdown.][markdown-site]

The code repository for this site can be found at
[github.com/esayler/esayler.github.io][site-repo].

You can also access this site by visiting either [esayler.github.io][my-github-pages-url] or [ericsayler.com](http://www.ericsayler.com).

The site will improve and grow as I learn more about Jekyll and I'm planning on blogging frequently and should have a few posts put up in the coming weeks!

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on Jekyll.
